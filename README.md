# Applescript Tools

## Description

A collection of Applescript scripts that help automate some stuff on Mac OS X

I have a few more of these but they are very "task oriented" and contain private
information such as hostnames and/or usernames. Thus, I can only share the
generic ones here - I will be adding more as I think they are ready for public
release.

## Installation

Nothing really special here. You can either use [FastScripts](https://red-sweater.com/fastscripts/)
or enable the [script menu](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/UsetheSystem-WideScriptMenu.html).
